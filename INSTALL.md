# Installing Hive

The compiler is one executable, `hivec`. It carries the Go it compiles against as
source text, so there is nothing to install beside it: put it on your `PATH`.
Every release has one for each platform Go targets, on the
[releases page](../../releases).

| also needed | for |
| --- | --- |
| **Go 1.24+**, on the `PATH` | `build`, `run` and `test`. `check` and `emit` need nothing |
| `git` | an import that names a repository |
| a network | the first build of a program that opens a database or draws a scene; both cache under `~/.hive` |

## Linux and macOS

```sh
chmod +x hivec
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv hivec ~/.local/bin/
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
to your shell's startup file.

On macOS, pick `arm64` for Apple silicon and `amd64` for Intel, and clear the
download's quarantine or Gatekeeper refuses it:
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/hivec`.

## Windows

In PowerShell:

```powershell
$dir = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Hive"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dir | Out-Null
Move-Item .\hivec.exe $dir
Unblock-File "$dir\hivec.exe"
$user = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$user;$dir", "User")
```

Open a new terminal afterwards. If SmartScreen asks, choose *More info → Run anyway*.

## Checking that it worked

```sh
$ hivec version
v0.2.9
$ printf 'proc main(): void {\n\techo "it works"\n}\n' > hello.hive
$ hivec run hello.hive
it works
```

If `run` says `go` is not on the `PATH`, the compiler is installed and Go is not:
[go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) has it.

## What it reads and writes

| variable | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `PATH` | where `go` and `git` are found |
| `HOME` (`USERPROFILE` on Windows) | where the cache goes: `~/.hive` |
| `HIVE_PROGRESS` | `1` always reports progress, `0` never; unset, only when standard error is a terminal |
| `GOTOOLCHAIN`, `GOFLAGS`, `GOPROXY`, … | Go's own, since a build runs Go |

```
~/.hive/pkg/<repo>@<commit>/   remote imports, cloned once
~/.hive/vendor/three@0.180.0/  the three.js a scene is drawn with
~/.hive/tool/godecl/           the reader for imported Go files
~/.hive/syslink.key            the cluster key hive.syslink nodes share
~/.hive/android.key            the key hive export signs apps with
```

The first three are fetched again if deleted. The keys are not: two nodes must
share one `syslink.key` (or the same `HIVE_SYSLINK_KEY`), and an app signed with a
new `android.key` will not install over one signed with the old.

## Building from source

Hive builds Hive, so `./bootstrap` needs a compiler to start from: `src/hivec` from
an earlier build, or one named with `HIVEC=/path/to/hivec`. A clean checkout
starts from the release [`seed/pinned.txt`](seed/pinned.txt) names, checked
against its digest:

```sh
tag=$(awk '$1=="tag:"{print $2}' seed/pinned.txt)
gh release download "$tag" --pattern hivec-linux-amd64 --dir /tmp
sha256sum -c <(printf '%s  /tmp/hivec-linux-amd64\n' \
  "$(awk '$1=="sha256:"{print $2}' seed/pinned.txt)")

chmod +x /tmp/hivec-linux-amd64
HIVEC=/tmp/hivec-linux-amd64 ./bootstrap    # the release builds src/hivec
./bootstrap                                 # which then builds itself
```

After that, `./hive` (`hive.cmd` on Windows) runs the compiler in `src/`.
[`seed/README.md`](seed/README.md) says how a release becomes the next seed.

### For another platform

A build leaves the Go module it compiled in `src/hivec.hive-build`, so Go can
cross-compile the compiler for anywhere it targets:

```sh
cd src/hivec.hive-build
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hivec.exe .
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 go build -o hivec-macos-arm64 .
```
