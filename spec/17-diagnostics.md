# 17 — Diagnostics

## 17.1 The format

Every error opens with where it happened:

```
code-examples/2 - Types/types.hive:41: expected `]` but found `,`
```

`file:line: message`. That is the shape editors expect, so wiring one up needs
nothing more than a compile command and a pattern to read its output with.

A message that runs on continues on **indented** lines, so one error stays one
entry in a quickfix list:

```
main.hive:12: cannot prove this index is in range: the index is a computed
    expression. Bind it to a variable and guard it (`if j >= 0 && j < len(v)`).
```

A compile error is printed exactly as the compiler wrote it, with **nothing in
front of it** — prefixing it with a program name would put something before the
file name and break the pattern. Only a usage error (`hive build` with no
entrypoint, a command that does not exist, a flag the command does not take)
says who is complaining — `hive: ...` — because it is not a diagnostic about
anyone's source. Either one exits non-zero.

Every error goes to **standard error**, so `hive emit x.hive > main.go` never
writes one into the Go. What a command was asked for — the Go, a test report,
"No problems found" — goes to standard output.

## 17.2 Editor support

In Vim or Neovim:

```vim
setlocal makeprg=hive\ check\ %:S
setlocal errorformat=%-G\ %.%#,%f:%l:\ %m,%-G%.%#
```

`hive check` runs every compiler pass and stops before the Go toolchain, so it
answers as fast as the front end does and writes nothing next to the file — which
is what makes it usable on every save. `:make` then fills the quickfix list, and
`:cn` walks the errors.

The two `%-G` items discard what is not a diagnostic: the first drops the
indented continuation lines of a message that runs on, the last drops everything
else.

## 17.3 A limit worth knowing

**Errors from the passes after parsing land on a declaration.** Mutability,
bounds, the proc/func split and the type checks all run on a flattened module
whose nodes carry a position on a declaration and nowhere else, so the
declaration the mistake is inside is as precise as they get: its line is what the
message opens with, and its name is what the message says. A pass holding no
declaration at all reports against the file's first line, because `file:0:` is
not somewhere to jump to.

The declaration still says which file it came from, so an error inside an
imported module names **that module's file**, and every name in the message is
spelled the way the source spells it — `text.pad`, not the flattened
`text_0_pad`. Errors the lexer, parser and import resolver raise name the right
file and line too; an import that names no file is reported at the import.

The limit is a consequence of one decision — that the passes after the loader see
one flat program — and would be lifted by carrying a position on every node.
[18](18-conformance.md) records this as a known gap rather than a requirement.

## 17.4 What a message should say

Not normative, but it is the standard the language's own messages are held to:

* **Name the thing.** `` `v` is declared `Str[3]` ``, not "type mismatch".
* **Say what to do.** A bounds error that cannot prove an index says how to
  guard it. A `sort` that cannot sort in place names both fixes.
* **Say why, when the why is the point.** `hive.math.max(0, health)` is rejected
  because Hive never widens a number behind your back; a message that only said
  "expected Float, found Int" would leave the reader hunting for the conversion
  they are supposed to have known about.
* **Never guess.** A misspelled keyword is reported as a miscased keyword *and*
  as a name that was taken, because both readings are live and the compiler
  cannot know which was meant.

## 17.5 The one diagnostic that is not an error

A test failure is an answer, not a malfunction, so the report goes to **stdout**
and only a compile error or a toolchain failure goes to stderr
([16](16-testing.md)).
